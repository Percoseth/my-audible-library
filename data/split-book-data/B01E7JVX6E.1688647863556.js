window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>It was supposed to be an easy job: find the Dark Star Revolution Starships, destroy them, and go home. But a booby-trapped vessel decimates the Meridian Alliance fleet, leaving <i>Serengeti</i> - a Valkyrie class warship with a sentient AI brain - on her own, wrecked and abandoned in an empty expanse of space. On the edge of total failure, <i>Serengeti</i> thinks only of her crew. She herds the survivors into a lifeboat, intending to sling them into space. But the escape pod sticks in her belly, locking the cryogenically frozen crew inside. Then a scavenger ship arrives to pick <i>Serengeti</i>'s bones clean. Her engine's dead, her guns long silenced; <i>Serengeti</i> and her last two robots must find a way to fight the scavengers off and save the crew trapped inside her. </p>";
