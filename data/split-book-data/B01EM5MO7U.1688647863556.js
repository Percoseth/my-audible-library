window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Enter the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Malazan universe with this prequel trilogy</b> </p> <p>Steven Erikson returns to the Malazan world with the second novel in a dark and revelatory new epic fantasy trilogy, one that takes place a millennium before the events in his <i>New York Times</i> bestselling Malazan Book of the Fallen. </p> <p>It's a conflicted time in Kurald Galain, the realm of Darkness, where Mother Dark reigns. But this ancient land was once home to many a power...and even death is not quite eternal. The commoners' great hero, Vatha Urusander, is being promoted by his followers to take Mother Dark's hand in marriage, but her Consort, Lord Draconus, stands in the way of such ambitions. The impending clash sends fissures throughout the realm. As rumors of civil war burn through the masses, an ancient power emerges from the long dead seas. Caught in the middle of it all are the First Sons of Darkness, Anomander, Andarist, and Silchas Ruin of the Purake Hold.... </p>";
