window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>\"Why do I have to have moral issues with killing someone? I feel like such a hypocrite! It's worse than a vegetarian touting organically grown steaks.\" (Eric, physics teacher, involuntary vampire, and part-time demon slayer) </p> <p>Eric didn't ask to be a vampire. In fact he didn't even believe in them. Biting your own tongue with your fangs does a lot of convincing. Even so, being a part-time undead isn't as easy as you might think. It can let you hold down a day job, true, but sometimes the night \"life\" can be more than a little difficult, what with those bloodthirsty urges and predatory instincts kicking in. Luckily for Eric he can rely on his trusty steed and her unwavering support, his flaming sword and its sarcastic wit, and his own snarky sense of humor. </p>";
