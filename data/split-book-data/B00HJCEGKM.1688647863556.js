window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>You define life or it defines you. In Shawn Speakman’s case, it was both. Lacking health insurance and diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma in 2011, Shawn quickly accrued a massive medical debt that he did not have the ability to pay. That’s when <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author Terry Brooks offered to donate a short story that Shawn could sell to help alleviate those bills - and suggested he ask the same of his other writer friends. <i>Unfettered</i> is the result: An anthology built in order to relieve that debt, featuring short stories by some of the best fantasy writers in the genre. </p> <p>Twenty-three tales comprise this incredible collection, and as the title suggests, the writers were free to contribute whatever they wished. Here is the table of contents: </p> <ul> <li>Foreword by Patrick Rothfuss</li> <li>Introduction: On Becoming Unfettered</li> <li>Imaginary Friends by Terry Brooks</li> <li>How Old Holly Came to Be by Patrick Rothfuss</li> <li>The Old Scale Game by Tad Williams</li> <li>Game of Chance by Carrie Vaughn</li> <li>The Martyr of the Roses by Jacqueline Carey</li> <li>Mudboy by Peter V. Brett</li> <li>The Sound of Broken Absolutes by Peter Orullian</li> <li>The Coach with Big Teeth by R. A. Salvatore</li> <li>Keeper of Memory by Todd Lockwood</li> <li>Heaven in a Wild Flower by Blake Charlton</li> <li>Dogs by Daniel Abraham</li> <li>The Chapel Perilous by Kevin Hearne</li> <li>Select Mode by Mark Lawrence</li> <li>All the Girls Love Michael Stein by David Anthony Durham</li> <li>Strange Rain by Jennifer Bosworth</li> <li>Nocturne by Robert V.

Sullivan</li> <li>The Duel by Lev Grossman</li> <li>Walker and the Shade of Allanon by Terry Brooks</li> <li>The Unfettered Knight by Shawn Speakman<p>With the help of stalwart friends and these wonderful short stories, Shawn has taken the gravest of life’s hardships and created something magical. <i>Unfettered</i> is not only a fantastic anthology in its own right, but it’s a testament to the generosity found in the science fiction and fantasy community—proof that humanity can give beyond itself when the need arises. After all, isn’t that the driving narrative in fantasy literature? </p></li> </ul>";
