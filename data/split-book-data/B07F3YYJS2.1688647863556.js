window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>This Audible Original production of Jane Austen’s <i>Emma </i>is narrated by Emma Thompson (Academy Award, Golden Globe, Emmy and BAFTA winner, <i>Love Actually</i>, Harry Potter, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>), with a full supporting cast including Joanne Froggatt (<i>Downton Abbey</i>, <i>Liar</i>), Morgana Robinson (<i>The Windsors</i>, <i>Walliams &amp; Friend</i>, <i>Morgana Robinson's the Agency</i>), Aisling Loftus (<i>Mr Selfridge</i>, <i>War &amp; Peace</i>), Joseph Millson (<i>Casino Royale</i>, T<i>he Sarah Jane Adventures</i>) and rising star Isabella Inchbald as our eponymous heroine.</p> <p>Before she began writing <i>Emma</i>, Austen wrote, 'I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like' and thus introduces the handsome, clever, rich - and flawed, Emma Woodhouse. Emma is perfectly content with her life and sees no need for either love or marriage; nothing however delights her more than matchmaking her fellow residents of Highbury. But when she ignores the warnings of her good friend Mr. Knightley and attempts to arrange a suitable match for her protegee Harriet Smith, her carefully laid plans soon unravel and have consequences that she never expected. This lively comedy of manners with its witty and subtle exploration of relationships, it is often seen as Jane Austen's most flawless work.</p> <p>Featuring: Alexa Davies, Joanne Froggatt, Adam Gillen, Rupert Holliday-Evans, Isabella Inchbald, Aisling Loftus, Anjella Mackintosh, Joseph Millson, Ukweli Roach, Morgana Robinson, Nicholas Rowe, Emma Thompson, Benjamin Wainwright, Eve Webster and Ria Zmitrowicz.</p>";
