window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Here is the much-anticipated new translation of Virgil's epic poem from the award-winning translator Robert Fagles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The publication of a new translation by Fagles is a literary event. His translations of both the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i> have sold hundreds of thousands of copies and have become the standard translations of our era. Now, with this stunning modern verse translation, Fagles has reintroduced Virgil's <i>Aeneid</i> to a whole new generation, and completed the classical triptych at the heart of Western civilization.</p> <p><i>The Aeneid</i> is a sweeping epic of arms and heroism and a searching portrait of a man caught between love, duty, and the force of his own destiny. Here, Fagles brings to life the timeless journey of Aeneas as he flees the ashes of Troy to found Roman society and change forever the course of the Western world.</p> <p>Fagles' translation retains all of the gravitas and humanity of the original as well as its powerful blend of poetry and myth.</p> <p>&nbsp;<b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>";
