window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Jon Ronson, the creator of Audible Original <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>, delves into the pornography industry again as he unravels the never-before-told story of what caused a beloved 23-year-old actress’s untimely death.</p> <p>In December 2017, famed adult film star August Ames died by suicide in a park in the Conejo Valley. Her death came just a day after she’d been the victim of a social media pile-on by fellow porn professionals—punishment for her tweeting out something deemed homophobic.</p> <p>A month later, August’s husband and pornography producer Kevin Moore connected with journalist Jon Ronson to tell the story of how cyberbullying via Twitter killed his wife. Neither of them could predict the rumors and secrets that Ronson would soon hear, revelations that hinted at a very different story—something mysterious and unexpected and terrible.</p> <p><b>Please note:</b> This audio features sexual content, adult language, and references to suicide and violence that may be upsetting to some listeners. Discretion is advised.</p> <p><i>If you or someone you know is struggling with thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741.</i>&nbsp;</p>";
