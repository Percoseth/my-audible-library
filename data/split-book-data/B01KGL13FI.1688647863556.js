window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>With all of the pluck and charm of its eponymous young hero, Rachel McAdams (<i>The Notebook</i>, <i>Spotlight</i>, <i>Midnight in Paris</i>) delivers a spectacular reading of Montgomery's beloved bildungsroman. In moments both funny and bittersweet, McAdams' voice is imbued with the spark that has made Anne a much-loved symbol of individualism and cheer for over a century. In this story of \"kindred spirits\", McAdams' touching and heartfelt narration proves she is just that - bonded on a deep level to this shimmering classic. </p> <p>When aging brother and sister Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert decide to adopt an orphan boy to help with chores around their farm, Green Gables on Prince Edward Island, neither is prepared for the feisty and imaginative redheaded girl who is mistakenly brought to them instead. Nor are they prepared for the way in which she will change their lives. Through a series of hilarious misadventures, Anne's uncompromising spirit makes her a striking presence in the close-knit village, bringing new friendships, first crushes, and, for her foster parents, a love and openness unimaginable before her arrival. </p>";
