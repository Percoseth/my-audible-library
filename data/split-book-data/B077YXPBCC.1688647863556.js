window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>Elysium Fire</i> is a smoldering tale of murderers, secret cultists, tampered memories, and unthinkable power, of bottomless corruption and overpowering idealism from the king of modern space opera. </b> </p> <p>Ten thousand city-state habitats orbit the planet Yellowstone, forming a near-perfect democratic human paradise. </p> <p>But even utopia needs a police force. For the citizens of the Glitter Band that organization is Panoply, and the prefects are its operatives. </p> <p>Prefect Tom Dreyfus has a new emergency on his hands. Across the habitats and their hundred million citizens, people are dying suddenly and randomly, victims of a bizarre and unprecedented malfunction of their neural implants. And these \"melters\" leave no clues behind as to the cause of their deaths.... </p> <p>As panic rises in the populace, a charismatic figure is sowing insurrection, convincing a small but growing number of habitats to break away from the Glitter Band and form their own independent colonies. </p> <p>For more from Alastair Reynolds, check out: </p> <p><i>Revenger</i> </p>";
